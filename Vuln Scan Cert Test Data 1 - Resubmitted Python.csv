In affected versions `Tss2_RC_SetHandler` and `Tss2_RC_Decode` both index into `layer_handler` with an 8 bit layer number, but the array only has `TPM2_ERROR_TSS2_RC_LAYER_COUNT` entries, so trying to add a handler for higher-numbered layers or decode a response code with such a layer number reads/writes past the end of the buffer. This Buffer overrun, could result in arbitrary code execution. An example attack would be a MiTM bus attack that returns 0xFFFFFFFF for the RC. Given the common use case of TPM modules an attacker must have local access to the target machine with local system privileges which allows access to the TPM system.

CVE-2023-3817,openssl,1.1.1k-9.el8_7,low,5.3,"Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.  Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.  An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.  The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check().  Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the ""-check"" option.

CVE-2023-45803,python3-urllib3,1.24.2-5.el8,moderate,4.2,"urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn\'t remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs. Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren\'t putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn\'t exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.

CVE-2024-24806,libuv,1.41.1-1.el8_4,moderate,7.3,"libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-24806,affected

PRISMA-2022-0168,pip,9.0.3,high,7.8,"An issue was discovered in pip (all versions) because it installs the version with the highest version number, even if the user had intended to obtain a private package from a private index. This only affects use of the --extra-index-url option, and exploitation requires that the package does not already exist in the public index (and thus the attacker can put the package there with an arbitrary version number). NOTE: it has been reported that this is intended functionality and the user is responsible for using --extra-index-url securely. This vulnerability was first assigned with CVE-2018-20225, but it is still under dispute. However, this vulnerability still poses a threat when using the --extra-index-url.",https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8606,open
